## `@Required`

The `@Required` annotation is applied to a field annotated with [`@Option`](option.html) or [`@Arguments`](arguments.html) to indicate that the option/argument must be specified.

```java
@Option(name = "--num", 
        arity = 1, 
        title = "Number")
@Required
private int number;
```

When a field is marked with `@Required` if the user fails to supply that option/argument then an error will be thrown during [parsing](../parser/)
