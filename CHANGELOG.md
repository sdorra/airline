# Airline - Change Log

## 2.1.1

## 2.1.0

- Module Additions and Changes
    - New `airline-help-man` module
        - `ManSections` moved into this module (**Breaking**)
    - RONN help generators moved to `airline-help-ronn` module (**Breaking**)
        - All RONN generators are marked as `@deprecated` since they are superseded by the Man and Markdown format generators
    - HTML help generators moved to `airline-help-html` module (**Breaking**)
    - Bash help generators moved to `airline-help-bash` module (**Breaking**)
        - `CompletionBehaviour` moved into this module (**Breaking**)
     - New `airline-help-markdown` module for generating Markdown help
- Help Improvements
    - New direct man page generation via `ManCommandUsageGenerator`, `ManGlobalUsageGenerator` and `ManMultiPageGlobalUsageGenerator` provided in the `airline-help-man`
        - These are intended to replace use of the existing RONN generators for generating Man pages
   - New direct Markdown generation via `MarkdownCommandUsageGenerator`, `MarkdownGlobalUsageGenerator` and `MarkdownMultiPageGlobalUsageGenerator`
        -  These are intended to replace use of the existing RONN generators for generating Markdown help
    - `CommandUsageGenerator` has new overloads that take a `ParserMetadata<T>` object, old overloads are deprecated in favour of these.  This allows generators to produce more accurate help in some circumstances.
    - Switched to using `ServiceLoader` to discover available help section factories avoiding the need to explicitly register these with `HelpSectionRegistry`
        - Provide a `META-INF/services/com.github.rvesse.airline.help.sections.factories.HelpSectionFactory` file to specify help section factories
        - `HelpSectionRegistry` moved to package `com.github.rvesse.airline.help.sections.factories` (**Breaking**)
        - `HelpSectionFactory` now required to implement a `supportedAnnotations()` method to declare the annotations it can turn into `HelpSection` instances (**Breaking**)
    - New `@Copyright` and `@License` annotations for adding copyright and license statements to help
    - New `@ProseSection` annotation for adding a custom prose section to help
    - Improved presentation of help hint for options/arguments annotated with `@Port`
    - Improved presentation of help hints for numeric ranges, they no longer show min/max if those are set to the min/max of their respective numeric types and the range is inclusive
    - Improved presentation of help hint for single value ranges
 - Metadata Changes
     - User alias configuration are now preserved on a `UserAliasesSource<T>` class which is accessible via `ParserMetadata<T>.getUserAliasesSource()`
     - `completionBehaviour` and `completionCommand` are no longer fields on the `@Option` and `@Arguments` annotation.  Instead use the `@BashCompletion` annotation from the `airline-help-bash` module
- Restriction Improvements
    - New `@Path` restriction for specifying that an arguments value is a path to a file/directory and applying restrictions on the path/file that should be enforced e.g. must exist, readable etc.
    - New `@MutuallyExclusiveWith` restriction for specifying that only one of some set of options may be specified but that those options are optional, this is thus a less restrictive version of `@RequireOnlyOne`
    - Switched to using `ServiceLoader` to discover available restriction factories avoiding the need to explicitly register these with the `RestrictionRegistry`
        - Factories are now required to implement a method indicating what annotations they can translate into restrictions (**Breaking**)
        - Provide a `META-INF/services/com.github.rvesse.airline.restrictions.factories.OptionRestrictionFactory` file to specify option restriction factories
        - Provide a `META-INF/services/com.github.rvesse.airline.restrictions.factories.ArgumentsRestrictionFactory` file to specify argument restriction factories
- Bug Fixes
    - `@Port` restriction would incorrectly reject valid values when applies to `@Arguments` annotated fields
    - Restrictions could report incorrect argument title when applied to arguments with multiple titles

## 2.0.1

- Bug Fixes
    - Fix `@MinLength` being an exclusive restriction i.e. value had to be greater than given length when intention was that value should be at least the given length
- Documentation
    - Add missing Javadocs to new annotations

## 2.0.0

2.0.0 represents substantial breaking changes over 1.x which were made to make the library more configurable and extensible.  We **strongly** recommend reading the included `Migrating.md` for notes on how to migrate existing Airline powered CLIs forward.

- Dependency Changes
    - Removed Guava
    - Added Apache Commons Collections 4
- Builder improvements
    - All parser related options on `CliBuilder` are now moved to `ParserBuilder` which is access by calling `.withParser()` on the `CliBuilder` instance
    - Groups now support sub-groups and `GroupBuilder` provides `withSubGroup()` and `getSubGroup()` for working with these
- Annotation Changes
    - Various fields were removed from existing annotations in favour of moving them to separate annotations
        - `@Command` removes `examples`, `discussion`, `exitCodes` and `exitCodeDescriptions`
        - `@Option` removes `required`, `allowedValues` and `ignoreCase`
        - `@Group` can now be used to create sub-groups by inserting spaces into group names e.g. `@Group(name = "foo bar")` creates a group `foo` with a sub-group `bar` and applies any other configuration given to the sub-group
        - New `@Cli` annotation can be used to define a CLI entirely declaratively
        - New `@Parser` annotation can be used to customise parser for CLIs created with `SingleCommand` or as a field on a `@Cli` annotation
        - `@Arguments` removes `required`
    - New annotations for adding extended help to commands
        - `@Discussion` to add discussion, this replaces the `discussion` field of the `@Command` annotation
        - `@Examples` to add examples, this replaces the `examples` field of the `@Command annotation
        - `@ExitCodes` to add exit codes, this replaces the `exitCodes` and `exitCodeDescriptions` fields of the 
        - Custom extended help sections can be created and registered such that they are automatically discovered by Airline
    - New restriction annotations for expressing restrictions on options and arguments
        - `@Required` to indicate required options/arguments, this replaces the `required` field on the `@Option` and `@Arguments` annotations
        - New `@RequiredOnlyIf` for conditionally requiring an option if another option is present
        - New `@RequireSome` for requiring at least one from some set of options
        - New `@RequireOnlyOne` for requiring exactly one from some set of options
        - `@AllowedRawValues` for limiting the raw string values an option can receive, this replaces the `allowedValues` and `ignoreCase` fields on the `@Option` annotation
        - New `@AllowedValues` for limiting the converted values an option can receive
        - New `@MaxLength` and `@MinLength` for limiting the length of the raw string values an option can receive
        - New `@MinOccurrences`, `@MaxOccurrences` and `@Once` for limiting how many times an option can appear
        - New `@LongRange`, `@IntegerRange`, `@ShortRange`, `@ByteRange`, `@DoubleRange`, `@FloatRange` and `@LexicalRange` for indicating that arguments once converted to the appropriate value type must fall within a given range
        - New `@Port` for restricting options to some port range(s)
        - New `@NotEmpty` and `@NotBlank` for requiring the raw string values be non-empty or non-blank (not all whitespace)
        - New `@Pattern` for requiring that the raw string values conform to some regular expression
        - New `@Unrestricted` to indicate that restrictions inherited from an overridden option should be removed
        - Custom restrictions can be created and registered such that they are automatically enforced by Airline
- Parser Improvements
     - `TypeConverter` is now an interface and configurable i.e. allows you to control how Airline turns raw string values into Java objects
     - Option parsing styles are now fully configurable (default behaviour remains as 1.x which uses the first 3 styles):
         - Classic GNU Get Opt Style
         - Long GNU Get Opt Style
         - Standard whitespace separated style
         - List value style i.e. `--name a,b,c` for higher arity options
         - Pair value style i.e. `--name a=b` for arity 2 options
         - Users can define and register their own custom option parsers as desired
     - Alias Improvements
         - Can now support optional alias chaining i.e. aliases can reference other aliases
- Metadata Improvements
     - Parsing specific metadata moved to `ParserMetadata` class which is accessible via `GlobalMetadata.getParserConfiguration()`
     - `GlobalMetadata` is now a generic class taking the command type as the type parameter
- Help Improvements
    - New `HelpHint` interface which is used by restrictions to provide help
    - New `HelpSection` interface for adding custom help sections to commands
    - More advanced and flexible formatting of extra help hints and sections in all existing generators
    - Help supports providing help for sub-groups, help for groups will include information about available sub-groups
