# Airline

Airline is an annotation-driven Java library for building Command Line Interfaces (CLIs), it supports simple commands all the way through to complex Git style CLIs with groups and user defined command aliases.

Airline aims to reduce the boiler plate code typically associated with CLIs in Java, many common behaviours can be achieved purely with annotations and zero user code.  Let's take a look at an ultra simple example:

{% include code/getting-started.md %}

This is explained in depth in the [Introduction to Airline](guide/) but essentially we had to do the following:

- Annotate our class with [`@Command`](annotations/command.html) to indicate that it is a command
- Annotate fields with [`@Option`](annotations/option.html) and [`@Arguments`](annotations/arguments.html) to indicate that they receive values from the command line
- Use `SingleCommand.singleCommand()` to create a parser from our class
- Call `parse()` to pass the command line arguments
- Implement our command logic as desired, here it is contained in the `run()` method
