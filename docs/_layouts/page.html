   <h3>Improving this Documentation</h3>
   <p>
     This documentation is itself open source and lives in GitHub at <a href="{{ site.github.repo }}/tree/master/docs">{{ site. github.repo }}/tree/master/docs</a>
   </p>
   <p>
     I am not a professional technical writer and as the developer of this software I can often make assumptions of knowledge that you as a user reading this may not have.  Improvements to the documentation are always welcome, if you have suggestions for the documentation please submit pull requests to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch.
   </p>
